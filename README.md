# polyAGM
Package for Property Prediction of Polymers based on Automatically Generated Motifs. We use graph kernel together with probabilistic methods to infer property predictions and their explanations.

This work was developed by Shannon R. Petersen, David Kohan Marzag√£o, Georgina L. Gregory, Yichen Huang, David A.
Clifton, Charlotte K. Williams, Clive R. Siviour at the departments of Engineering, Chemistry and Computer Science of the University of Oxford. 

The experiments described in the paper (and fully reproducible here) were run on a M1 Pro MacBook Pro, 32GB. 

The requirements can be installed with 'pip install -r requirements_polyagm.txt'.
